# JaneSimulator
This Python script (main.py) will run a Monte Carlo simulation to answer two related probability questions:

PART A: "A family has two children. If one is a girl, what is the probability that they are both girls?"

PART B: "A family has two children. If one is a girl named Jane, what is the probability that they are both girls?"

Most people will read these two questions and conclude that the answer must be the same. But surprisingly, it's not!

Before you run the script, try to work out for yourself what the answer to each part is, and why the seemingly irrelevant information in Part B changes the answer.

After you have worked it out for yourself and run the script, you can look at ANSWER.md to better understand what's going on here.

(Note: It's not a trick question. Just a math question with a surprisingly counter-intuitive answer.)
