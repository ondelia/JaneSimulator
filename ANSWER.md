# ANSWER TO THE QUESTION
Note: You should NOT read any further until you have read the README file and run the Python script!

PART A: "A family has two children. If one is a girl, what is the probability that they are both girls?"

PART B: "A family has two children. If one is a girl named Jane, what is the probability that they are both girls?"

The answer to Part A is 1/3. The answer to Part B is 1/2. 

By adding the seemingly irrelevant information about the girl's name, we have changed the question because we are now referring to a *specific* child, whereas in Part A we were just referring to *either* child.

We can re-word both questions to hopefully make this clearer:

PART A: "A random child has one sibling, and at least one of them is a girl. What is the probability that they are both girls?" (1/3)

PART B: "Jane is a girl with one sibling. What is the probability that they are both girls?" (1/2)
